					A full-time people photographer originally

				<div class="text-element">
					Somewhere in my 24 years I fell in love with photography. 
					I have only been shooting "professionally" for about a year, 
					but freezing moments in time is what I have come to love most in life.

				<div class="text-element">
					Besides taking pictures & editing, 
					you can find me at a coffee shop chatting with friends, 
					riddling off puns, hiking the foothills, obsessing over bulldogs, 
					cooking with my boyfriend, or watching the Kardashians in their 
					latest scandal.  
				</div>
				<div class="text-element">
					Couples, portraits, babies, families, you name it - 
					I hope you let me take it!
